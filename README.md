# Mr-Robot-Webshop

Important note: this is a very old project written for my bachelor's thesis.
It doesn't reflect my current skill-set and is not being actively maintained.

Simple webshop application

It uses MS SQL Server 2019 and Entity Framework as the orm.

The back-end is written in .NET Core (with C#).

The front-end is written in simple HTML/CSS with JavasScript and JQuery.
